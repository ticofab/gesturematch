# GestureMatch
GestureMatch is a backend service that enables a new form of communication between mobile devices, that is extending hand gestures from one screen across into another. Imagine a swipe or pinch across two screens.

We built a startup on top of this technology, called CloudMatch - 
<http://cloudmatch.io>. The idea was to provide an SDK to integrate such functionality in mobile apps, and bill per usage. We met a lot of enthusiasm, but as it turned out, generate revenues was beyond our reach. 

The SDK and demos are available at the CloudMatch github account.

This project makes intense use of WebSockets.
